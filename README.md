###every dApp has 3 parts
####1.)smart contract
handles users, nfts , how to test your work. Its like the database and law of your app development
In part one, we saw how Reach can be installed with one command on almost any system without any dependencies beyond what most developers have anyways.440
In part two, we saw how Reach programs have a succinct setup that easily abstracts the details of your chosen consensus network into a couple lines and three key API calls.441
In part three, we saw how Reach allows developers to focus on the business logic of their decentralized application and look past the nitty-gritty details of blockchain interaction and protocol design.442
In part four, we saw that it is just as easy for Reach to deal with tokens and network transactions as it is to deal with data sharing.443
In part five, we introduced you to the Reach automatic formal verification engine and its ability to ensure our program doesn't have entire categories of flaws and security vulnerabilities.444
In part six, we saw how Reach allows you to specify how to deal with non-participation and protect against funds being locked in contracts.445
In part seven, we saw how Reach can express arbitrary length interactions and how flexible the Reach frontends are to variations in the backend.446
In part eight, we saw how to decouple your Reach program from the Reach standard testing environment and launch an interactive version on a real network.447
In part nine, we saw how to deploy your Reach program as a fully decentralized Web application
####2.)front end
how your websites will appear(we will use react)
####3.)back end
how do you fetch user data from smart contract
